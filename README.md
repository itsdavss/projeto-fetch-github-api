## Overview

### About

The goal of this website is to display detailed information about the requested GitHub user, including their name, bio, number of followers, the number of people they follow, a list of their repositories, and their most recent activities on the platform.

## My process

This project was developed as part of the DevQuest course. Initially, we followed the instructor in creating the main structure, and then we were asked to add new features, such as:

- Displaying the number of followers and the number of people the user follows
- Showing information about the user's most recent events on GitHub
- Displaying the number of forks, stars, watchers, and the programming language of each repository

Although it wasn't required, I decided to make some changes to the responsiveness of the project. I realized that some elements could be improved to offer a better experience on different devices, so I adjusted the layout to make it more responsive and visually consistent.

### Challenges and learnings

Without a doubt, something I really enjoyed learning was the code refactoring part. Initially, we did everything in just one script file, and then we refactored it into a much more organized and readable structure, assigning specific tasks to each file. This made the project much easier to maintain, modify, and add new features.
